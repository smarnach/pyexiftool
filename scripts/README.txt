These are standardized scripts/batch files which run tests, code reviews, or other maintenance tasks in a repeatable way.


While scripts could automatically install requirements, it is left up to the caller:

<script>_requirements.txt files are what extra pip requirements are required to run the <script>


install with:
	python -m pip install -U -r <requirements file>
