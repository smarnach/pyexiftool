07/17/2019 12:26:16 AM (PDT) | 0.1     | Source was pulled directly from https://github.com/smarnach/pyexiftool with a complete bare clone to preserve all history.  Because it's no longer being updated, I will pull all merge requests in and make updates accordingly
07/17/2019 12:50:20 AM (PDT) | 0.1     | Convert leading spaces to tabs
07/17/2019 12:52:33 AM (PDT) | 0.1.1   | Merge [Pull request #10 "add copy_tags method"](https://github.com/smarnach/pyexiftool/pull/10) by [Maik Riechert (letmaik) Cambridge, UK](https://github.com/letmaik) on May 28, 2014<br> *This adds a small convenience method to copy any tags from one file to another. I use it for several month now and it works fine for me.*
07/17/2019 01:05:37 AM (PDT) | 0.1.2   | Merge [Pull request #25 "Added option for keeping print conversion active. #25"](https://github.com/smarnach/pyexiftool/pull/25) by [Bernhard Bliem (bbliem)](https://github.com/bbliem) on Jan 17, 2019<br> *For some tags, disabling print conversion (as was the default before) would not make much sense. For example, if print conversion is deactivated, the value of the Composite:LensID tag could be reported as something like "8D 44 5C 8E 34 3C 8F 0E". It is doubtful whether this is useful here, as we would then need to look up what this means in a table supplied with exiftool. We would probably like the human-readable value, which is in this case "AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor 18-70mm f/3.5-4.5G IF-ED".*<br>*Disabling print conversion makes sense for a lot of tags (e.g., it's nicer to get as the exposure time not the string "1/2" but the number 0.5). In such cases, even if we enable print conversion, we can disable it for individual tags by appending a # symbol to the tag name.*
07/17/2019 01:20:15 AM (PDT) | 0.1.3   | Merge with slight modifications to variable names for clarity (sylikc) [Pull request #27 "Add "shell" keyword argument to ExifTool initialization"](https://github.com/smarnach/pyexiftool/pull/27) by [Douglas Lassance (douglaslassance) Los Angeles, CA](https://github.com/douglaslassance) on 5/29/2019<br>*On Windows this will allow to run exiftool without showing the DOS shell.*<br>**This might break Linux but I don't know for sure**<br>Alternative source location with only this patch: https://github.com/blurstudio/pyexiftool/tree/shell-option
07/17/2019 01:24:32 AM (PDT) | 0.1.4   | Merge [Pull request #19 "Correct dependency for building an RPM."](https://github.com/smarnach/pyexiftool/pull/19) by [Achim Herwig (Achimh3011) Munich, Germany](https://github.com/Achimh3011) on Aug 25, 2016<br>**I'm not sure if this is entirely necessary, but merging it anyways**
07/17/2019 02:09:40 AM (PDT) | 0.1.5   | Merge [Pull request #15 "handling Errno:11 Resource temporarily unavailable"](https://github.com/smarnach/pyexiftool/pull/15) by [shoyebi](https://github.com/shoyebi) on Jun 12, 2015
07/18/2019 03:40:39 AM (PDT) | 0.1.6   | set_tags and UTF-8 cmdline - Merge in the first set of changes by Leo Broska related to [Pull request #5 "add set_tags_batch, set_tags + constructor takes added options"](https://github.com/smarnach/pyexiftool/pull/5) by [halloleo](https://github.com/halloleo) on Aug 1, 2012<br> but this is sourced from [jmathai/elodie's 6114328 Jun 22,2016 commit](https://github.com/jmathai/elodie/blob/6114328f325660287d1998338a6d5e6ba4ccf069/elodie/external/pyexiftool.py)
07/18/2019 03:59:02 AM (PDT) | 0.1.7   | Merge another commit fromt he jmathai/elodie [zserg on Mar 12, 2016](https://github.com/jmathai/elodie/blob/af36de091e1746b490bed0adb839adccd4f6d2ef/elodie/external/pyexiftool.py)<br> seems to do UTF-8 encoding on set_tags
07/18/2019 04:01:18 AM (PDT) | 0.1.7   | minor change it looks like a rename to match PEP8 coding standards by [zserg on Aug 21, 2016](https://github.com/jmathai/elodie/blob/ad1cbefb15077844a6f64dca567ea5600477dd52/elodie/external/pyexiftool.py)
07/18/2019 04:05:36 AM (PDT) | 0.1.8   | [Fallback to latin if utf-8 decode fails in pyexiftool.py](https://github.com/jmathai/elodie/commit/fe70227c7170e01c8377de7f9770e761eab52036#diff-f9cf0f3eed27e85c9c9469d0e0d431d5) by [jmathai](https://github.com/jmathai/elodie/commits?author=jmathai) on Sep 7, 2016
07/18/2019 04:14:32 AM (PDT) | 0.1.9   | Merge the test cases from the [Pull request #5 "add set_tags_batch, set_tags + constructor takes added options"](https://github.com/smarnach/pyexiftool/pull/5) by [halloleo](https://github.com/halloleo) on Aug 1, 2012
07/18/2019 04:34:46 AM (PDT) | 0.3.0   | changed the setup.py licensing and updated the version numbering as in changelog<br>changed the version number scheme, as it appears the "official last release" was 0.2.0 tagged.  There's going to be a lot of things broken in this current build, and I'll fix it as they come up.  I'm going to start playing with the library and the included tests and such.  <br>There's one more pull request #11 which would be pending, but it duplicates the extra arguments option.  <br>I'm also likely to remove the print conversion as it's now covered by the extra args.  I'll also rename some variable names with the addedargs patch<br>**for my changes (sylikc), I can only guarantee they will work on Python 3.7, because that's my environment... and while I'll try to maintain compatibility, there's no guarantees**
07/18/2019 05:06:19 AM (PDT) | 0.3.1   | make some minor tweaks to the naming of the extra args variable.  The other pull request 11 names them params, and when I decide how to merge that pull request, I'll probably change the variable names again.
07/19/2019 12:01:22 AM (PDT) | 0.3.2   | fix the select() problem for windows, and fix all tests
07/19/2019 12:54:39 AM (PDT) | 0.3.3   | Merge a piece of [Pull request #11 "Robustness enhancements](https://github.com/smarnach/pyexiftool/pull/11) by [Matthias Kiefer (kiefermat)](https://github.com/kiefermat) on Oct 27, 2014<br>*On linux call prctl in subprocess to be sure that the exiftool child process is killed even if the parent process is killed by itself*<br>also removed print_conversion<br>also merged the common_args and added_args into one args list
07/19/2019 01:18:26 AM (PDT) | 0.3.4   | Merge the rest of Pull request #11.  Added the other pieces, however, I added them as "wrappers" instead of modifying the interface of the original code.  I feel like the additions here are overly done, and as I understand the code more, I'll either remove it or incorporate it into single functions<br>from #11 *When getting json results, verify that the results returned by exiftool actually belong to the correct file by checking the SourceFile property of the returned result*<br>and also *Added possibility to provide different exiftools params for each file separately*
07/19/2019 01:22:48 AM (PDT) | 0.3.5   | changed a bit of the test_exiftool so all the tests pass again
01/04/2020 11:59:14 AM (PST) | 0.3.6   | made the tests work with the latest output of ExifTool.  This is the final version which is named "exiftool"
01/04/2020 12:16:51 PM (PST) | 0.4.0   | pyexiftool rename (and make all tests work again) ... I also think that the pyexiftool.py has gotten too big.  I'll probably break it out into a directory structure later to make it more maintainable
02/01/2020 05:09:43 PM (PST) | 0.4.1   | incorporated pull request #2 and #3 by ickc which added a "no_output" feature and an import for ujson if it's installed.  Thanks for the updates!
04/09/2020 04:25:31 AM (PDT) | 0.4.2   | roll back 0.4.0's pyexiftool rename.  It appears there's no specific PEP to have to to name PyPI projects to be py<something>.  The only convention I found was https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0423/#use-standard-pattern-for-community-contributions which I might look at in more detail
04/09/2020 05:15:40 AM (PDT) | 0.4.3   | initial work of moving the exiftool.py into a directory preparing to break it down into separate files to make the codebase more manageable
03/12/2021 01:37:30 PM (PST) | 0.4.4   | no functional code changes.  Revamped the setup.py and related files to release to PyPI.  Added all necessary and recommended files into release
03/12/2021 02:03:38 PM (PST) | 0.4.5   | no functional code changes.  re-release with new version because I accidentally included the "test" package with the PyPI 0.4.4 release.  I deleted it instead of yanking or doing a post release this time... just bumped the version.  "test" folder renamed to "tests" as per convention, so the build will automatically ignore it
04/08/2021 03:38:46 PM (PDT) | 0.4.6   | added support for config files in constructor -- Merged pull request #7 from @asielen and fixed a bug referenced in the discussion https://github.com/sylikc/pyexiftool/pull/7
04/19/2021 02:37:02 PM (PDT) | 0.4.7   | added support for writing a list of values in set_tags_batch() which allows setting individual keywords (and other tags which are exiftool lists) -- contribution from @davidorme referenced in issue https://github.com/sylikc/pyexiftool/issues/12#issuecomment-821879234
